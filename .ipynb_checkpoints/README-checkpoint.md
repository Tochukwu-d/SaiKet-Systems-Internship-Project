**Project Title: Customer Segmentation Visualization & Advanced Analysis**

**Project Overview:**
The project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunications company and develop predictive models to identify at-risk customers. 
The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

**- Task 1: Understand the Data**
Description:
Familiarize yourself with the dataset.
Steps:
Load the dataset using pandas.
Display the first 10 rows.
Identify the data types of each column.
Check for missing values.

Skills :
Data loading.
exploring datasets.
identifying data issues.

**- Task 2: Data Cleaning ( Ensure the dataset is
clean for analysis.)**

Description:
Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., fill,
drop, or impute).
Remove duplicate records, if any.
Standardize column names (convert to
lowercase and replace spaces with
underscores).

Skills :
Cleaning data.
handling missing values.
and data preparation.

**- Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Description:
Understand trends and distributions in
the data.
Generate summary statistics (mean,
median, mode).
Create visualizations for numerical
columns (histograms, box plots).
Analyze churn rates (e.g., churn vs. non-
churn proportions).

Skills :
Statistical analysis
data visualization.

Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn.


**- Tasks 4: Customer Segmentation Visualization**

Description:
Visualize customer distribution by tenure
using pie or donut charts. (e.g., 0-12
months, 13-36 months, 37+ months).
Use a clustered bar chart to compare
average monthly charges across tenure
categories,
adding annotations to highlight significant
trends.

Skills :
Pie charts
clustered bar charts
interactive visualization.

Tools: Matplotlib, Plotly

**- Task 5: Advanced Analysis**

Description:
Perform a deeper analysis by grouping customers
by tenure to compute statistics for charges and
churn.
Analyze churn rates by demographics (e.g.,
gender, senior citizen status).
payment methods, and contract types.
Visualize trends over time (if applicable) or
lifecycle stages to identify patterns.

Skills :
Data Grouping
Statistical Analysis
Data Visualization
Demographic Analysis
Comparative Analysis
